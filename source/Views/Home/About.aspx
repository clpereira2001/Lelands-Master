        <div class="page_title">LELANDS HISTORY</div>
        Lelands is the largest and most respected Sports Auction House in the world. We have handled such landmark collections as 
        The Mickey Mantle Auction of the Greer Johnson Collection ($1.3M), The Harry M. Stevens Auction ($1.8M), and the famed Boston 
        Garden Auction ($2M total sales). We have also auctioned important individual pieces like The Babe Ruth Sale Document ($99,000),
        Mickey Mantle's 1960 Jersey ($111,100) and perhaps the single most famous transaction in sports memorabilia history, the sale of
        the infamous "Mookie Ball" to the actor Charlie Sheen for $93,500.
        <br />
        Over the past five years, Lelands has sold over $40 million worth of vintage sports memorabilia and cards.
        <br /><br />
        We have also handled important collections of all types, not just sports. This includes The Howdy Doody Auction featuring the 
        collections of Buffalo Bob Smith, Lew "Clarabell" Anderson, propmaster Scott Brinker & producer Roger Muir. In this auction we sold 
        one of the original Howdy Doody puppets for over $113,000.
        <br /><br />
        Lelands has also conducted highly successful charity auctions for the Jackie Robinson Foundation, the Baseball Assistance Team 
        (B.A.T.), and Major League Baseball (where we auctioned "on-site" the uniforms worn in Baltimore's 1993 All-Star Game).
